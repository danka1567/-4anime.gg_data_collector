# 4Anime Data Extractor  this code use this api for data extract https://4anime.gg/ajax/episode/list/355

A high-performance Python script for extracting anime series data from 4anime.gg with TMDB integration for enhanced metadata.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Massive Scale Processing**: Handles 10,000+ anime URLs (ID range: 10,000-20,000)
- **Dual Episode Support**: Extracts both single episodes and episode ranges
- **Async Processing**: Ultra-fast concurrent processing using `aiohttp` and `asyncio`
- **TMDB Integration**: Automatically fetches metadata from The Movie Database
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error URL tracking

### Technical Features
- **High Concurrency**: Configurable worker threads (default: 30 async workers)
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars with `tqdm`
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Automatic error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Memory Efficient**: Batch processing to handle large datasets
- **Dual Processing Modes**: Both async and sync versions available

## üìä Data Extraction

### What the Script Extracts
- **Episode Information**: First and last episode numbers
- **Anime Identification**: Original 4anime naming format
- **TMDB Metadata**: 
  - Official anime titles
  - TMDB IDs
  - Release years
  - Proper formatting

### Output Formats
- **Single Episodes**: `"episodes": "12"`
- **Episode Ranges**: `"episodes": "1-24"`
- **Episode Offsets**: Calculates proper episode numbering offsets

## üõ† Installation & Requirements

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 tqdm aiohttp
